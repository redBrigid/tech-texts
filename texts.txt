HOW TO DISPLAY IONIC BLOCK ELEMENTS IN ROW?

It can't be done just by changing block display to inline in CSS.
For putting elements one by another is used grid.
In React I need to import IonGrid, IonRow and IonCol.
Columns can have integer size from 1 to 12 (but can be overwriten to another max value in sass predefined variables).
By default the size of all elements in row is equal but I can manually set column's size:
<IonCol size="5">
What means that this column will take 5 units of 12.
